# Asynchronicity

*Asynchronous* Something else is doint the work & we are not waiting
*Concurrent* Many things are running at once => it is observable
*Parallel* Many things are running at the same time

# Takeaways
- By default run on the main thread
- IO.shift when you want to run on another ThreadPool

? Retry & clarify what happens when shifting inside / outside flatMap
? and also Async
